## Simple Summary
I see a lot of backlash against the pylon community pick and not so much the other options. So, I am going to include the top 2 highest voted coins currently other than pylon. And the third one will be USDC for the more stability-oriented users to have an option. 
This would make the Proposal include DXD, REN, and USDC for 90/10 Balancer pools so there is significantly less impermanent loss if price starts to climb. 
We as the BOOST community can vote with our Boost tokens instead of a possibly botted Discord pairing us with potentially malicious projects. 
Stay Boosted.
## Abstract
The purpose of this proposal is to ensure that only the BOOST holders have the say in what other projects they want to integrate with. No risk of botting or people without a stake in the project getting their voices heard more so than BOOST holders. These 3 pools, if voted to pass, will be given 5000 Boost tokens as incentives for providing liquidity in the 90/10 Balancer pools. This means you only need to hold 10% of the value you add to the pool in Boost and 90% will be the other token, this significantly reduces your potential for Impermanent Loss in relation to Boost.
## Motivation
I think Boost holders should vote with their Boost if and whenever applicable. More power to the Boost holders!
